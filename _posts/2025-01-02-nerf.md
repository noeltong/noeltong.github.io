## Implicit Neural Representation (INR)

* Explicit representation
    - Conventional approaches to encoding input signals as representations typically follow an explicit paradigm, where the input space is discretized or partitioned into separate elements (e.g., point clouds, voxel grids, and meshes).
    - Explicit (or discrete) representations directly encode the features or signal values.
* Implicit neural representation (INR)
    - Implicit representations are defined as a generator function that maps input coordinates to their corresponding value within the input space.
    - A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained to parameterize the signal of interest, such as an image or shape, utilizing coordinates as input.
    - The objective is to predict the corresponding data values at those coordinates. Thus, the MLP serves as an Implicit Neural Representation function that encodes the signal's representation within its weights.
